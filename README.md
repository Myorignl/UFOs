# UFOs
In this scenario Dana is 

## Overview of the analysis:
In this assignmen we use Java Script to create a webpage that contains an interactive table. The table is created with multilpe filters that delivers the inforation available by identifying that a change has taken place in the selected fields (filter boxes). The filtering is conducted using d3 an event listener added to the HTML file.The listener allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results:

Dana should know that once the webpage is open the table will display all of the data availalbe. The end user can enter the information they want to sort the data with and the table will return all the incidents that meet the set criteria.The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input. If the end user want to return to view all the data the filters should be empty and the page refreshed. 
The data can be sorter by: 
- Date 
- City
- State 
- Shape of object

## Summary:
In summary we created a table to hold and display the UFO information. This was done via an HTML page that was created using Java / HTML / CSS / and Bootstrap. An Image was added to the background making the table looks professional. 
Here is an example of what the page looks like, and a view of filtered data

### Things to improve 
- A draw back to this format is the lack of current data. The webpage could benefit from up to date data by continuously updating the information automatically. 

To address this drawback my recomendation is to:  

- extract the data from a reliable webpage
- read the webpage html
- parse through the data and 
- map the pertinent information into the table we want to create. 

The process then needs to be automated and run continuosly. This is a implified version of all the steps that need to take place. 

My second recomentation to improve the page: 

- Addition of an outcome olumn that would provide information of sighting being investigated and confirmed.
